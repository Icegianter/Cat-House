Decided against heating units and I'll rely on insulation. Also figured against using a mosquito mister.
The purose of this would be to spray the entrance as the cats come in to deflect any mosquitos from entering and harrasing them inside.
My new plan is since I am purchasing 4 fans, to 3D print tubes to re-route some of the air to blast diagonally out infront of the door
to blow away any mosquitos. Inspiration for this came from walijng in and out of stores and havingthe large fans turn on above me doing
the same thing. The servo will open the cat door when triggered by the RFID tag, that way only my cats can come in and no one else.

The above total comes out to roughly $240 USD, so I will try to find some things on Aliexpress

So total without the deals is about $345, and that's without the needed wood for the build. With deals it becomes $300 roughly, leaving $50
for wood, but I have a lot of wood and shingling sitting around in my garage, so that's not a problem. The concern is I need tech to make
the project functional and come to life.
