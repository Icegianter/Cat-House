I know that this is pushing the cutoff time with the end of this Hackathon being the 31st, but might aswell try to squeeze it in. Got the first CAD model done for the cat house, definitely need to add more components, and also need to make it to size, currently is not.

Day 2: July 26 -
Today I worked on creating a shopping list of all items I'll be needing technology wise. For now it's all on Amazon, tomorrow I'll check Aliexpress. I cut out some of my plans because it just wouldn't work with the tech, but eventually I think I found everything I need. Now I need to calculate the size of the house to bring the model to scale and figure out how much wood I need.
